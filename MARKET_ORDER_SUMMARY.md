# ✅ Market Order Implementation Complete

## 🎯 What Changed

Your trading bot has been updated to use **market orders** for immediate execution at current market prices.

## 📊 New Trading Logic

### Before (Limit Orders):
- Buy at specific bid/ask prices
- Wait for price to be reached
- May not execute if price doesn't reach target

### Now (Market Orders):
- Buy at current market price
- Execute immediately
- Guaranteed fill

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Buy Alert (`/ML-3-4/buy`)
```python
# OLD: Buy at bid price with limit order
result = await trading_bot.buy_contracts_limit(3, None, use_bid=True)

# NEW: Buy at market price with market order
result = await trading_bot.buy_contracts(3)
```

### Sell Alert (`/ML-2-3-4/sell`)
```python
# OLD: Close at ask price with limit orders
result = await trading_bot.sell_contracts_limit(position.quantity, None, use_ask=True)

# NEW: Close at market price with market orders
result = await trading_bot.sell_contracts(position.quantity)
```

## 📈 Execution Flow

### Buy Process:
1. Receive buy alert
2. Create market order for 3 contracts
3. Send to IBKR immediately
4. Execute at current market price
5. Return result

### Sell Process:
1. Receive sell alert
2. Get current positions
3. Create market orders for each position
4. Send all orders to IBKR immediately
5. Execute all at current market prices
6. Return results

## 🎯 Benefits
