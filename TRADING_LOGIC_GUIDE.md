```

## 🔧 Key Components

### Market Data Retrieval
```python
# Request market data
ticker = ib.reqMktData(contract, '', False, False)

# Wait for data
await asyncio.sleep(1.5)

# Extract prices
bid = ticker.bid    # Price to sell at
ask = ticker.ask    # Price to buy at
last = ticker.last  # Last traded price
```

### Order Creation
```python
# Buy order
buy_order = LimitOrder('BUY', quantity, ask_price)

# Sell order
sell_order = LimitOrder('SELL', quantity, bid_price)
```

### Order Execution
```python
# Place order
trade = ib.placeOrder(contract, order)

# Wait for execution
while not trade.isDone():
    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)

# Check result
if trade.orderStatus.status == 'Filled':
    # Success!
    filled_qty = trade.orderStatus.filled
    avg_price = trade.orderStatus.avgFillPrice
```

## 📈 Price Logic

### Why Use Bid/Ask?
- **Bid Price**: What you get when selling (lower price)
- **Ask Price**: What you pay when buying (higher price)
- **Spread**: Difference between bid and ask

### Example:
```
ES Price: $6695.25
├── Bid: $6695.25 (sell at this price)
├── Ask: $6695.50 (buy at this price)
└── Spread: $0.25 (cost of trading)
```

## 🚨 Error Handling

### Common Errors:
1. **Connection Lost**: Reconnect to IBKR
2. **No Market Data**: Retry or use last known price
3. **Order Not Filled**: Check market conditions
4. **Timeout**: Order took too long to execute

### Fallback Strategies:
1. **Force Close**: Close all positions regardless of price
2. **Market Orders**: Use market orders if limit orders fail
3. **Retry Logic**: Retry failed orders

## 🎯 Webhook Integration

### Buy Webhook (`/ML-3-4/buy`)
```
TradingView Alert → Webhook → Bot
├── Get market data
├── Buy 3 contracts at ask price
└── Return result
```

### Sell Webhook (`/ML-2-3-4/sell`)
```
TradingView Alert → Webhook → Bot
├── Get current positions
├── Get market data
├── Close all positions at bid/ask
└── Return result
```
